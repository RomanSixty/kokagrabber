About

KoKaGrabber is a simple project to grab the event list from koka36.de and
mark newly added events for a better overview. It updates in a maximum
frequency of three hours and marks events added in the last 24 hours or
since last visit.


Requirements

The tool uses phpQuery to scrape the events from an HTML page. You can
install that from the PEAR repository using

  pear channel-discover phpquery-pear.appspot.com
  pear install phpquery/phpQuery

Also it uses SQLite as database backend. On Debian Linux this can be
installed by calling

  apt-get install php5-sqlite
