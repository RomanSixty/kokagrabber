About

KoKaGrabber is a simple project to grab the event list from koka36.de and
mark newly added events for a better overview. It updates in a maximum
frequency of three hours and marks events added in the last 24 hours or
since last visit.


Requirements

The tool uses phpQuery to scrape the events from an HTML page. Since the
PEAR package is no longer maintained, you have to get it from here:

  https://code.google.com/archive/p/phpquery/downloads

The default inclusion path is set to "/usr/lib/phpquery", you can change
that in /lib/koka_update.php.

Also the tool uses SQLite as database backend. On Debian Linux this can
be installed by calling

  apt-get install php5-sqlite
